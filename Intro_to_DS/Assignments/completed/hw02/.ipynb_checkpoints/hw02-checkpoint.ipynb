    "##### Weighing the traits\n",
    "After computing dissimilarities between several schools, you notice a problem with your method: the scale of the traits matters a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since schools cost tens of thousands of dollars to attend, the cost-to-attend trait is always a much bigger *number* than most other traits.  That makes it affect the dissimilarity a lot more than other traits.  Two schools that differ in cost-to-attend by $\\$900$, but are otherwise identical, get a dissimilarity of $900$.  But two schools that differ in graduation rate by $0.9$ (a huge difference!), but are otherwise identical, get a dissimilarity of only $0.9$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to fix this problem is to assign different \"weights\" to different traits. For example, we could fix the problem above by multiplying the difference in the cost-to-attend traits by $.001$, so that a difference of $\\$900$ in the attendance cost results in a dissimilarity of $\\$900 \\times .001$, or $0.9$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a revised method that does that for every trait:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each trait, subtract the two schools' trait values.\n",
    "2. Then take the absolute value of that difference.\n",
    "3. Now multiply that absolute value by a trait-specific number, like $.001$ or $2$.\n",
    "4. Now, sum the 1000 resulting numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2.** Suppose you've already decided on a weight for each trait.  These are loaded into an array called `weights` in the cell below.  `weights.item(0)` is the weight for the first trait, `weights.item(1)` is the weight for the second trait, and so on.  Use the revised method to compute a revised dissimilarity between University A and University B.\n",
