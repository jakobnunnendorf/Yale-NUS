    "Data, analytics, and machine learning have become ubiquitous around sports over the past decade or so. One of the values of sports analytics is in opposition scouting, for example what an optimal strategy might look like. Today we are going to analyse the serving stragegy in tennis sport (Please refer to the [link](https://www.keithprowse.co.uk/news-and-blog/2019/01/02/tennis-terminology-explained/) on Essential terminology of tennis sport). \n",
    "\n",
    "In tennis, the player serving the ball has an advantage because they are able to start the **point** — giving them strategic choices like where to place the ball and what type of spin to hit with. The serve is also one of the fastest shots in tennis. Not only that, but the server gets two chances at their serve in case they miss the first. So first serves are typically hit with the intent to give the server a strong advantage. They are powerful and sometimes erratic, but the server can take some risk because there is always a second chance with the second serve. As second serves have no such safety net, they are by and large delivered with more caution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most players, amateur and professional, employ two different serves: players typically use their first serve to play a ball faster and into tighter, more advantageous windows, such as out wide or down the center of the “T,” where the service boxes meet. The point is to gain an advantage by forcing a weak return, pushing the opponent into an undesirable court position, or winning the point uncontested through an **ace**. The second serve, then, is typically played more safely. Players tend to use play a slower ball into windows with a higher margin for error. The player will still attempt to gain an advantage by controlling the opponent’s court position, but the advantage tends to be smaller than on a successful first serve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy for players comes down to maximizing their chance of winning a point on serve. Let's call this `p_Won`. To get the explicit formula we need a few more quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    "`p_1stIn` : the probability of first serve landing it in,\n",
    "\n",
    "`p_1stWon`: the probability of winning on first serve given that it lands in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, `p_2ndIn` and `p_2ndWon` be the corresponding probabilities on the second serve. Note by assigning an initial random value to these names, we are just declaring these variables in Python. The values of these variables can be updated."

In addition, for private housing, there are three difference indices due the difference between landed and non-landed. To make the situation simple, there are three assumptions: First, we use the average of four quarters to be the housing indices for the corresponding year. Second, we ingore landed private housing as it's a niche asset class, so we only use non-landed residential entries. Third, as we can only calculate if there are data available, so we only consider the maximum shared year range in all three files. Create a table `final_raw` consists of four columns in the special order `Year`, `TFR`,`HDB_Index` and `Private_Index`. (10 points) "
